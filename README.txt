Package Delivery System

IMPORTANT PROJECT INFORMATION:

1. YOU CANNOT RUN THE PACKAGE SIMULATION TWICE WITHOUT GETTING INACCURATE DATA THE SECOND TIME:

	THIS IS DUE TO THE PYTHON COMPILER AND INTERPRETER [BASICALLY THE INFORMATION FROM THE FIRST 
	RUNTHROUGH GETS CACHED AND IS THEN REFERENCED THE SECOND TIME AROUND].

2. THIS PROJECT WAS BUILT WITH PYTHON3, BUT SHOULD WORK WITH PYTHON2, IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE, UPGRADE

3. DUE TO IT BEING PYTHON 3, YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE INIT FILES TO RUN IN COMMAND PROMPT, IF YOU ARE HAVING
   TROUBLE LOADING PROJECT, PLEASE DOWNLOAD PYCHARM AS AN IDE AND USE IT TO RUN THE PROGRAM.
	


Welcome to the UPS Package Delivery System:

QuickStart:
    1. Clone this repository
    2. Load it into your favorite python interpreter. (I used pycharm)
    3. Run main.py (it should be noted that you may have to run it in the GUI and not through command line, sometimes
        CMD has trouble reading my modules).

Project Summary:
    This project takes package information from csv/excel sheets and attempts to find the shortest route between all
    packages in the csv file. I wanted to learn more about certain data structures, so I used those data structures to
    implement the project. See below for specific outcomes.


Outcomes:
    1. Learned about certain data structures: graphs, PQueues, Heaps, and Hashtables.
    2. Learned about Djikstra's algorithm.
    3. Learned about Graph Theory.
