IMPORTANT PROJECT INFORMATION:

1. YOU CANNOT RUN THE PACKAGE SIMULATION TWICE WITHOUT GETTING INACCURATE DATA THE SECOND TIME:

	THIS IS DUE TO THE PYTHON COMPILER AND INTERPRETER [BASICALLY THE INFORMATION FROM THE FIRST 
	RUNTHROUGH GETS CACHED AND IS THEN REFERENCED THE SECOND TIME AROUND].

2. THIS PROJECT WAS BUILT WITH PYTHON3, BUT SHOULD WORK WITH PYTHON2, IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE, UPGRADE

3. DUE TO IT BEING PYTHON 3, YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE INIT FILES TO RUN IN COMMAND PROMPT, IF YOU ARE HAVING
   TROUBLE LOADING PROJECT, PLEASE DOWNLOAD PYCHARM AS AN IDE AND USE IT TO RUN THE PROGRAM.

4. LOCATION FOR INFORMATION PROJECT:
	A: IN CORE ALGORITHM

	B1: IN CODE--

	    IN TRUCK CLASS BEFORE PRIORITIZE PACKAGE METHOD [WHICH IS THE NEAREST NEIGHBOR ALGORITHM]
	    IN DIJKSTRA CLASS BEFORE BOTH IMPLEMENTATIONS OF DIJKSTRA
	    COMMENTS AND REGULAR LOGIC ARE WITHIN ALL CLASSES
	
	B3:IN CODE --
	    IN TRUCK CLASS BEFORE PRIORITIZE PACKAGE METHOD
	    IN DIJKSTRA CLASS BEFORE BOTH IMPLEMENTATIONS OF DIJKSTRA
	    IN HASHTABLE CLASS BEFORE INSERT,FIND,SEARCH, AND DELETE FUNCTIONS
	    IN HEAP BEFORE ALL RELEVANT FUNCTIONS [INSERT, REMOVE, SWAP, BUBBLE UP, BUBBLE DOWN, ETC.]
	    IN PRIORITY QUEUE BEFORE ALL METHODS

	C1: IN CODE--
	    IN MOST CLASSES, SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE: PRIORITY QUEUE, HEAP, AND HASH TABLE CLASSES
	
	C2: COMMENTS ARE IN THE CODE, ALL OVER THE CODE

	D1: IN CORE ALGORITHM DOCUMENT

	E: IN THE CODE, IN THE HASH TABLE CLASS, IN THE DATAREADER IS WHERE
	   THE DATA IS READ FROM THE CSV FILES AND INSERTED INTO THE HASH TABLE

	F: IN THE CODE, IN THE HASH TABLE CLASS, IN THE DATAREADER IS WHERE
	   THE DATA IS READ FROM THE CSV FILES AND INSERTED INTO THE HASH TABLE
